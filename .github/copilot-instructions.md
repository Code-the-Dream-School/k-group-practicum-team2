# Copilot instructions

This application is being built by a team of students, so when you perform code review, please:

* Provide explanations that are simple and easy to understand.
* Ignore issues with accessibility labels and tags.
* Ignore Ruby code style nits (because we already have a `lint` CI workflow that runs RuboCop).
* Avoid suggesting placeholder links and addresses that may go to a real person.
