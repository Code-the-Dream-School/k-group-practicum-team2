# Copilot instructions

This application is being built by a team of students, so when you perform code review, please:

* Provide explanations that are simple and easy to understand.
* Ignore issues with accessibility labels and tags.
* Ignore Ruby code style nits (because we already have a `lint` CI workflow that runs RuboCop).
* When you need placeholder links, domains, email addresses, or other contact info, use only clearly fictitious examples such as `https://example.com` or `user@example.com`, and avoid placeholders that could plausibly belong to a real person or organization.
